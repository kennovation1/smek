These are the saved and exported files from the WinIPAC4 utility (installed and ran on Debbie's PC) that reprogram the IPAC4 to output:

I needed to avoid function and other keys since they are interpreted by the Mac
before the program gets them. I think that some other keys (e.g., number pad
digits) are translated by OSX before I get them).

See IPAC files IPACmapping4.ipc (.xml and .raw versions are human readable)

All of the following are printable on OSX
